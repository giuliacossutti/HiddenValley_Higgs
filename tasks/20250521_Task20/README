Description:
- Simulation of 500K events for each process (1 signal, 4 bkgs)
- Studies on signal and bkgs by filling histograms of signal and 4 bkg and then stacking and merging.
  Signal xsection = sum of all bkgs xsections.
  All plots in root files to be used for figure of merit and best cuts' determination.
  A preselection on events is applied:
  - At least 2 small jets
  - 2 charged leptons with same flavour, opposite charge, | Invmass - mZ | < 10 GeV, ZpT > 20 GeV

Files from the various samples are distinguished by a tag: signal_EJ, bkg_Zjets_q, bkg_Zjets_g, bkg_ZZ, bkg_HZ_SM
'''
If they contain:
_sample0 : signal
_sample1 : bkg_HZ_SM
_sample2 : bkg_ZZ
