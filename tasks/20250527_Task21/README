Description:
- Simulation of 2M events for each Z+jets bkg process, output in eos
- Studies on signal and bkgs by filling histograms of signal and 4 bkg and then stacking and merging.
  Signal xsection = sum of all bkgs xsections.
  Signal area = sum of all bkgs areas.
  All plots in root files to be used for figure of merit and best cuts' determination.
  A preselection on events is applied:
  - At least 2 small jets
  - 2 charged leptons with same flavour, opposite charge, | mll - mZ | < 10 GeV, ZpT > 20 GeV

***
Files from the various samples are distinguished by a tag: signal_EJ, bkg_Zjets_q, bkg_Zjets_g, bkg_ZZ, bkg_HZ_SM
'''
If they contain:
_sample0 : signal
_sample1 : bkg_HZ_SM
_sample2 : bkg_ZZ
_sample3 : bkg_Zjets_g
_sample4 : bkg_Zjets_q
'''
Two series of 1D plots were made:
*.pdf : stack of backgrounds + overlapped signal
*_stack.pdf : stack of backgrounds and signal
'''
If they contain:
area_ : produced by MergeHistosArea.C, Signal area = sum of bkgs areas
_abstract : used for thesis abstract in PhD applications
_poster : used for ATLAS Week poster, June 2025
